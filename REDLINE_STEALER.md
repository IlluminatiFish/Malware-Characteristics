## Abstract

Redline Stealer is a Information Stealer written in C# that was first observed in March of 2020 and advertised on various cyber criminal forums as a 'Malware-as-a-Service' (MaaS) system, Redline mainly targets the Windows operating system
and steals things such as cryptocurrency wallets, browser information, FTP connections, game chat launchers (like Discord), OS information, IP geolocation and the default system language.

## How is it spread?

Redline Stealer spreads predominantly by social engineering techniques and other methodologies on platforms such as YouTube & Discord.
Usually what I see happen on the YouTube side is compromised or bot youtube channels upload a video with the promise of cracked software or game hacks
where instead it is a Redline Stealer executable continuing the never ending chain of infections, as many people still fall for this. Whereas for the Discord side
since Discord is used by mostly gamers it is spread via social engineering techinques by compromised accounts asking to 'test out a game' or that the executable file gives them 'free items'

On YouTube you can easily tell if a video is spreading Redline Stealer as they have quite
distinct characteristics as listed below:

- YouTube channel uploading it is completely unrelated to the content being posted on it
- URL shortened download link (i.e. bitly, bitdo, cuttly)
- Uses a free file storage host (i.e. MegaNZ, Mediafire, GitHub, GitLab)
- Excessive use of capital letters and/or combinations of words to entise the victims
- Uses 3-5 digits or characters as the supposed zip file password
- Has a huge list of tags in the description related to the victim's search query

Similarly these characteristics can be seen in the messages sent by compromised Discord accounts to unsuspecting victims.

Below is a diagram of the threat cycle I have deduced from months of research

## How does it work?

On the dynamic analysis side conducted in popular Malware Analysis Sandbox ANYRUN,
we can see that Redline currently uses XML over TCP as a method of data exfiltration,
whereas in mid-2021 it was still using the SOAP over HTTP technique as a method for data exfiltration.

Redline usually appears after executing the target executable in the form of an `AppLaunch.exe` process being spawned by the host machine
